"""Pure aggregation over a run's JSONL events into per-topic funnel
counts. Counts only what the agent's pipeline already decided — never
recomputes a filter. `scored`/`kept` only mean anything for a real run
(no rank stage exists in a dry run), so `is_real_run` tells the caller
whether those two columns are meaningful."""
